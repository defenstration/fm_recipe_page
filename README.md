## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I've never worked with HTML tables, so that was good to get some experience with. With that, I also used :last-child for the first time so I got to play with that psuedo element. I also liked getting some more experience with a responsive site that changes when moving to a smaller screen. 

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
